# UZUMETA ERC4907 Scholarship extension contracts

### UZUMETA for ETHIndia 2022

UZUMETA is a ERC-4907 based NFT game rental protocol to help gamers easily start Web3/blockchain games. A user can borrow a game item NFT from other people, play the game with the items, and share the earnings with lender.

### The problem it solves

According to the report from DApp Radar, games are leading the usage and adoption of blockchain based on the number of unique active wallets, dominating 42% of all UAW.

However, there is a big blocker for new users to buy a NFT when they want to play a game and participate in its ecosystem. For example, when StepN was launched on January of 2022, a user had to buy shoes which costed at least $500 to participate in StepN. So a few blockchain games developed and operated a scholarship program, which was rental and revenue sharing mechanism.

However, the scholarship programs are not decentralized and automated, which has a trust problem between manager and scholar. That is, a manager manually distributes the revenue from rental process to scholars.

- However, UZUMETA runs the scholarship based on the smart contract of ERC-4907 and share revenues in an automated and trustless way.
